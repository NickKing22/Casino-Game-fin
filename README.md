This repository is a simple modified game of CRAPS, it has a .css, .js, and a .html file.
Each file works together to play the game properly and how it was programmed.
The .js file contains a few types of functions, loops, and statements.
The html file contains all of the paragraphs and headers so that the user can understand what the website is about.
